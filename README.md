# DryClean_Facets
A review on Facets and a potential implementation of DryClean

#### DryClean implementation:
We start by creating a Panel of Normal (**PON**) for the DryClean pipeline;   
A 100 randomly sampled Breast Cancer; Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma; Gene Panel 468 (n = 2,705 samples) - retrieved from cBIO (07/07/2021) will be used to create the PON. Note, that this selection was arbitrarily chosen.
